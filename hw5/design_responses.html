                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned how it is very useful to implement a 12-unit grid for designing websites. This is because 12 grids are easy to divide up and combine into 2, 3, and 4 unit grids. Grids can help create a more organized layout for the website while drawing the user's attention to specific content if needed. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was how it imposed the different grid-layouts over a variety of websites. This helps to give me an idea of how to use the 12-unit grid and how popular websites fit into this design concept. Color-coding the different grids when websites used more than one type of grid was also helpful in visualizing it better. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration was Etsy's website as it maintained a very elegant and user-friendly interface while implementing more than one column grid style. Etsy's interface achieved their goal by combining multiple grid-styles, eg. 6, 4, 3 columns. They used these grids to organize their website in a fashion that was easy to understand while being visually appealing to the eye. Emphasis was also drawn toward certain parts of the interface by breaking away from this grid-layout and highlighting the main focus of the page. </p>

                            <p> 8. I enjoyed reading this article because it explained the concept in a concise way without too many words and used plenty of visual examples to break up the reading into smaller parts. </p>
