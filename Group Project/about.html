      <div id="body">

        <div class="text">King Pin Donuts is a family owned and operated business that has been around since the 1930's. We use fine ingredients and traditional methods to produce exceptional donuts, cakes, muffins, pastries, and cookies. King Pin has been a pioneer in the baking industry by being the first to offer trans-fat free products in the United States. While we continually strive for innovation at King Pin Donuts, we're still making our creations the way Dari (the new owner since 1980) intended to feed his young kids; great quality, daily fresh, and good service. We are proud and honored to gain your trust as our customers.
