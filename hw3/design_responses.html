						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that many good websites have color schemes that are just composed of variations of a single color rather than a palette of select colors. For example, on the Facebook website, much of the colors are just variations of a single blue color. The search bar is actually not black overlaid on blue, but a darker variation of the original blue. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when it explained the reason behind why hue went down for the darker variation of coral but went up for the darker variation of teal. This is due to which minimum point(red, green, blue) on the graph of luminosity the original color is closest to. For example, the coral was nearest to red, so hue shifted down towards that minimum point. The teal color on the other hand was closest to blue, so hue shifted up towards that minimum point. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> So when it comes to color variations, ask yourself: do I need simply a lighter or darker variation on a color I already have? (And if youre going for something clean and simple, the answer is so, so often yes) </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 9. I really enjoyed reading this article because it went in-depth into the science behind color variations yet presented the information in an easy to understand way. </p>
