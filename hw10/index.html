                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that many programming languages are designed with other languages in mind. That way, if one programming language is learned, then learning other ones will be much easier. For instance, learning Java will make it a lot faster to learn Python later on. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was how it used the extended analogy of love in programming languages. Poems were also used to make the article interesting and fun. The analogy of love made the example code easy to read and understand too. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
                            <p> Write code which addresses humans and machines alike. </p>
                        </li>
						<li>
							<p>Which part of JavaScript do you have the most trouble with?</p>
							<p> Selecting certain CSS selectors in JavaScript and altering the value in those selectors. For example, I have trouble knowing the exact JavaScript syntax to change the background of the body in css. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Does this article help with your understanding of JavaScript?</p>
							<p> Not really because I already understood the basics of JavaScript since I have prior coding experience. </p>

                            <p> 6. The analogy of love, poems, and regular human language used throughout the article was a unique comparison and made the content interesting to read and understand. </p>

                            <p> Page transitions - is there a way to maintain the state of a navigation bar being opened/viewable when changing to the next page after the user clicks on the link to that page on the menu bar?(ie. the menu bar stays open instead of closing when the next page loads) </p>

                            <p>Our next class, on Tuesday (12/3) after break, will be about getting into design or web development as careers. Do you have any questions that you'd like us to cover?</p>
                            <p> What are beginner web developers or students potentially interested in doing more design able to do to make themselves stand out in the playing field? Are portfolios used? What is some advice on developing a portfolio? Are there are any careers that are related to an overlap between software engineering and web development/design? </p>
