						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how the Gestalt principles are a series of visual perception principles from German psychologists. It theorizes how visual elements are perceived by people and the relationship between elements in certain conditions. The main components of Gestalt that apply to UI design include proximity, common region, similarity, closure, symmetry, continuation, and common fate. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how it used plenty of side-by-side comparison images to show how a particular Gestalt principle manifests in a webpage. For instance, for the symmetry principle, the article illustrates how adding a degree of asymmetry in conjunction with an overall symmetrical design can better capture the user's attention. Symmetry can help the user focus on the highlights of the webpage while asymmetry can aid in making a deeper impression on the user. </p>

							<p> Having an understanding how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication. </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 6. This article was interesting and engaging to read and was very informative. However, I think it could be organized better especially in the transition from the 4 key ideas in Gestalt principles to the Gestalt principles applicable and informative to UI design. </p>
