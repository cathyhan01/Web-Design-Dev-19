					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how contrast is important in creating accessible websites for users. Only using colors is also not the best way to maximize accessibility. Including other visual elements such as patterns or text labels may help those who have trouble discerning colors. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was how it included a helpful list of resources to ensure whether one is creating an accessible website. For instance, accessibility auditing services can help figure out whether the website is compatible with technologies that assist people with disabilities. It would also be useful to recruit people with disabilities in order to research and test the accessibility of a website. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool.</p>
							<p> When designers hide descriptions or directions in their forms, theyre sacrificing usability in favor of simplicity. </p>
