              <p>This week, we will work with Javascript, event handlers, and arrays to turn your computer into an instrument.</p></div>

<p>At the end of this lab, you should have something like this (no sound):</p>
<video controls>
    <source src="assets/videos/final.mov" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<h2 id="background-info">Background info</h2>
<p>For this assignment you will need to refer to both the HTML and the JavaScript files, but you will only need to alter the JavaScript.</p>

<p>Let's take a look closely at what's inside our HTML file. Take inside the class <code>.grid</code>. These are tiles with class <code>grid-cell</code> that represent the sounds that we play. 
Note the id's like <code>brass-soundtile</code> --> they're connected with what sound we want to play.</p>
<p>Now scroll to the bottom of the HTML file. We have a bunch of <code>audio</code> tags with <code>sound </code>files we want to play. Also note the ids. Do they seem familiar?</p> 


<p>Let's get familiar with a few new things in our JavaScript file. Take a look at our arrays: <code>keys</code>, <code>sounds</code>, and <code>colors</code>. Note how they all have 9 items in them, one for each tile we see on the screen. The idea is that, when we press a key, we want to play a sound, and flash a color.</p>
<p>To achieve this effect, we have two event handlers: <code>onkeydown</code> and <code>onkeyup</code>. This handles what happens when we press down on a key, and lift up from a key, respectively. </p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Let's create our DJ app by playing a sound inside our <code>onkeydown</code> function! Note that <code>onkeydown</code> takes a parameter called event. We console logged it for you, so check your inspector in your browser and see what it prints!</p>
<p>From there let's think about what we should do for these arrays. Look again above to see what we want to do when we press a key. If we look at our grid and match the arrays <code>keys</code>, <code>sounds</code>, and <code>colors</code>, 
we see that they are already in order for us! That's great!</p>

<p>We want to do the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Get and store the index of the key that we pressed (what's <code>event.key</code>?) using <code>.indexOf()</code>. This is a new function that finds the index of the element that we pass in.</li>
<li>Use this index to get the corresponding sound in <code>sounds</code> and color in <code>colors</code>. Call these values <code>soundId</code> and <code>colorId</code></li>
<li>Inside our conditional statement, we haven't assigned values to <code>sound</code> or <code>tile</code>. Let's use <code>document.getElementById</code>to find the right id for our 
<code>sound</code> tag and <code>.grid-cell</code> element. Do you remember how they're related?</li>
<li>If you got that working, everytime you press a key, it plays!</li>
<li>Change the background-color of <code>tile</code> to <code>colorId</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Mission accomplished! But you might have noticed that once we press a key, the color doesn't change back. Let's change that.</p>
<p>What we want to do is that when we let go of the key, all the tiles return to the color <code>#333333</code>.</p>
<ol>
    <li>In our <code>onkeyup</code> function, let's use <code>document.getElementByClassNames</code> to select all elements with class <code>.grid-cell</code></li>
    <li>Use a for loop to go through each element (how many are there?) using <code>.length</code>. Inside our for loop, set each element's background color back to black.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we can play music and look so cool doing so :)</p>
