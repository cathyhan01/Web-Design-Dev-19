						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that whitespace should best be used in an established system of multiples of 'n' pixels in order to ensure consistency and easy maintenance. That way, adjusting and changing the layout in terms of the number of pixels will be easier to do. For instance, Wayfair intentionally implements a system of multiples of 8 pixels in their website designs. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorte part of this article was how it provided images of real sites to demonstrate the importance and functionality of whitespace. They have side-by-side comparisons of what looks good and what does not look good, explaining how and why one layout appeals better to the user. I also liked how the article did not use a lot of techinical terms, making it easier to read and understand. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think youre using too much white space? Theres a good chance youre not. If anything, youre probably not using enough. When in doubt, add more white space..." </p>
						</li>
