						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how the speed of animations is really important. It depends on several factors such as the size of the object being animated and the distance it travels across the page. The size of the monitor(eg. desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, etc.) also matters in determining the speed of the animation for a particular element. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how it consistently uses side by side animated comparisons to show what good design practices are and what bad ones look like. I also liked how the article went in depth about ease-in and ease-out acceleration curves. The graphs explained the concept well and illustrated what an implementation of each variant would look like and what it would be best suited for. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the users attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another." </p>
						</li>
